The VPS must be powered down to perform the necessary configuration changes.
We will use VPS container `dockertest.corey-regan.ca` for the following instructions.

``` bash title="Stop the running VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# vzctl stop dockertest.corey-regan.ca
Stopping the Container ...

Container was stopped
Unmount image: /vz/private/e54b18b7-1491-4861-8c7c-9b46ce30852d/root.hdd
Container is unmounted
```

``` bash title="Enable network bridging on the VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# prlctl set dockertest.corey-regan.ca --features bridge:on
set features: bridge:on
The CT has been successfully configured.
```

``` bash title="Enable full access to netfilter features for the VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# prlctl set dockertest.corey-regan.ca --netfilter full
Set netfilter: full
The CT has been successfully configured.
```

``` bash title="Restart the VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# vzctl start dockertest.corey-regan.ca

``` bash title="Install Docker on the VPS, assuming the repo is already configured"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# prlctl exec dockertest.corey-regan.ca yum install docker -y
```

``` bash title="Enable the Docker service for automatic startup on system reboot, and start the Docker service on the VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# \
prlctl exec dockertest.corey-regan.ca systemctl enable docker && \
prlctl exec dockertest.corey-regan.ca systemctl start docker
```

``` bash title="Verify the Docker service is running as expected on the VPS"
[root@virtuozzo ~]# prlctl exec dockertest.corey-regan.ca systemctl status docker
