When you go to import an existing Azure Linux VM that was configured with an SSH key pair, Azure will give you a hint about the public key it expects, but it will fail when you copy/paste it.

Terraform will tell you what it expects to receive when setting `admin_ssh_key`:
```bash title="What Terraform expects"
- admin_ssh_key { # forces replacement
    - public_key = <<-EOT
          ---- BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
          Comment: "description of ssh key here"
          (redacted)
          ---- END SSH2 PUBLIC KEY ----
      EOT -> null
    - username   = "my_admin_username" -> null
  }
```

But if you configure the `admin_ssh_key` block to the suggestion, it'll fail:
```bash title="decoding admin_ssh_key.0.public_key for public key data"
│ Error: decoding "admin_ssh_key.0.public_key" for public key data
│
│   with azurerm_linux_virtual_machine.my_vm,
│   on virtual_machines.tf line 39, in resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "my_vm":
│   39: resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "my_vm" {
```

## The Solution
The solution is rather simple: ignore the `admin_ssh_key`
```terraform, title="Ignore the admin_ssh_key"
resource "azurerm_linux_virtual_machine" "my_vm" {
  name = "my_vm"

  ...

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      admin_ssh_key, # Changing this forces VM replacement. Also needed to import the VM into Terraform
    ]
  }
}
```

Terraform is useful for initial setup, but past standing up the VM you should really use another tool like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to manage your SSH keys on a machine.
