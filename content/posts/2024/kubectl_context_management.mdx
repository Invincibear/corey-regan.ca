## Kubectl config commands
`kubectl config` allows us to manage the configs of the various k8s clusters we manage.
Here's a quick list of available commands, of which we will focus on `clusters` and `contexts`:
```bash title=" "
kubectl config -h

Available Commands:
  current-context   Display the current-context
  delete-cluster    Delete the specified cluster from the kubeconfig
  delete-context    Delete the specified context from the kubeconfig
  delete-user       Delete the specified user from the kubeconfig
  get-clusters      Display clusters defined in the kubeconfig
  get-contexts      Describe one or many contexts
  get-users         Display users defined in the kubeconfig
  rename-context    Rename a context from the kubeconfig file
  set               Set an individual value in a kubeconfig file
  set-cluster       Set a cluster entry in kubeconfig
  set-context       Set a context entry in kubeconfig
  set-credentials   Set a user entry in kubeconfig
  unset             Unset an individual value in a kubeconfig file
  use-context       Set the current-context in a kubeconfig file
  view              Display merged kubeconfig settings or a specified kubeconfig file
```

`kubectl config get-clusters` gives us a list of k8s clusters that we've configured in `kubeconfig`.
