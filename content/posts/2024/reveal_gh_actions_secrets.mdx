You can create or add to an existing workflow a job step that `echo`s a secret and pipes it into `sed` which will add a space between each character, thereby tricking & bypassing GitHub's secrets exposure analysis, revealing secrets in plaintext.
```bash title="An example gh-actions workflow that reveals secrets"
name: Reveal Secrets
on: [workflow_dispatch]
jobs:
  reveal-secrets:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Reveal secrets
        run: |
          echo "SECRET_NAME=${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}" | sed 's/./& /g'
```

After merging the PR into your `master`/`main` branch, you can go to your repo's Actions, select this new Workflow, and manually run the Workflow. In the Workflow's output you will see the revealed secrets. Copy/paste the results into a text editor and search/replace the space character with nothing.

<Callout>Ensure you delete all Workflow runs that revealed secrets. Also delete the Workflow YAML itself.</Callout>

If your secrets contain spaces, modify the `sed` command to inject one or more special characters instead of spaces: `sed 's/./&!!!/g'`
```bash title="Try using special characters when you need to preserve spaces in secrets"
echo "secret contains spaces" | sed 's/./&!!!/g'
s!!!e!!!c!!!r!!!e!!!t!!! !!!c!!!o!!!n!!!t!!!a!!!i!!!n!!!s!!! !!!s!!!p!!!a!!!c!!!e!!!s!!!
```
