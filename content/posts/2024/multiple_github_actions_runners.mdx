# Have a free GitHub account and want to use a self-hosted runner for more than one repo?
You have a free GitHub account and want to use the same machine (like a VPS, or a VM, or a dedicated host) to perform your CI/CD jobs.
Unfortunately, unless you pay GitHub and create an Organization you won't be able to configure one runner on multiple repos.

Fortunately, there is an easy solution:
<br />**You can install multiple runners on the same machine by installing each runner in its own folder**
<br clear="left"/>

In this example, there are two runners on the machine, one which builds and deploys my portfolio website, and one for this blog:
```bash title=" "
/var/actions-runners# tree -L 1
.
├── corey-regan.ca
└── corey-regan.ca-blog
```


## Configure the self-hosted runner on your machine
#### Pick an installation directory
Choose where on your machine to store your runners, I chose `/var/actions-runners`.
I'll create the subdirectories that will contain our two runners, `corey-regan.ca` and `corey-regan.ca-blog`, name them appropriately for your needs.
We will then change its owner and apply a sticky bit to the group so that subsequently created folders and files are always owned by the `gh-runner` group.
```bash title=" "
mkdir -p \
    /var/actions-runners/corey-regan.ca \
    /var/actions-runners/corey-regan.ca-blog
```


#### Create a new user & group for the runner
Create a new user and group for the runners, using the `-r` flag to create a system account will have no password set,
no home directory, and its shell set to `/usr/sbin/nologin`, which should reduce their permissions to a minimal level necessary.
This is important because the runner will be exposed to the internet, so we should attempt to mitigate this potential attack vector.
```bash title=" "
sudo groupadd -r gh-runner
sudo useradd -r -g gh-runner -s /sbin/nologin gh-runner
```

#### Apply directory permissions
We'll make the `gh-runner` user & group the owner of the installation directory,
and configure it so that subsequent files/folders are always owned by `gh-runner` by applying a [sticky bit to the group ownership](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/suid-sgid-sticky-bit).
```bash title=" " /chmod g+s/
chown -R gh-runner:gh-runner /var/actions-runners
chmod g+s /var/actions-runner
cd /var/actions-runners
```

You can see the sticky bit applied to the directory, look for the "`S`" in the listed permissions of the current directory.
```bash title=" " /drwxr-Sr-x/
/var/actions-runners$ ls -lsah
total 16K
4.0K drwxr-Sr-x  4 gh-runner gh-runner 4.0K May  5 12:29 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 16 gh-runner gh-runner 4.0K May  5 11:15 ..
4.0K drwxr-xr-x  2 gh-runner gh-runner 4.0K May  5 11:45 corey-regan.ca
4.0K drwxr-xr-x  5 gh-runner gh-runner 4.0K May  5 12:18 corey-regan.ca-blog
```

#### Personalized instructions from GitHub

You can get personalized installation instructions from GitHub which includes a download link for the latest version of the runner software, as well as a secret token to securely connect the runner to GitHub.

Visit your GitHub repository and click on `Settings`. In the left nav bar, expand `Actions` and click on `Runners`.

Click on the `New self-hosted runner` button in the top-right of the `Runners` page.

Select the appropriate OS and architecture of the machine the runner will be installed on to generate the personalized installation instructions.

At this point, you should have:
- Downloaded the runner installation package
- Extracted the installer
- Installed the runner


#### Runner-as-a-service
We can configure the runner as a service to survive reboots and always start with the machine, configured to run as `gh-runner`:
```bash title=" "
sudo ./svc.sh install gh-runner

Creating launch runner in /etc/systemd/system/actions.runner.Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog.service
Run as user: gh-runner
Run as uid: 1009
gid: 1009
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/actions.runner.Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog.service → /etc/systemd/system/actions.runner.Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog.service.
```

We also need to start the service for the first time:
```bash title=" "
sudo ./svc.sh start

/etc/systemd/system/actions.runner.Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog.service
● actions.runner.Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog.service - GitHub Actions Runner (Invincibear-corey-regan.ca-blog.corey-regan.ca-blog)

             └─1626835 ./externals/node16/bin/node ./bin/RunnerService.js
```

We can verify the new runner connected to GitHub by refreshing the Runners page:

And we can also confirm this by querying the status of the runner's service:
```bash title=" "
sudo ./svc.sh status

## Configure your github-actions file
Congrats, you now have a self-hosted runner that GitHub can farm builds to!
There is one final step though, you need to configure your workflows to use the new runner.
By default, GitHub actions run on GitHub-provided servers.
Free accounts have a couple-thousand hours per month of free runtime for private repos, and unlimited hours for public repos.
Pro accounts get more hours, but that may be insufficient depending on your bespoke needs.

Self-hosted runners have no such limitations, and have the advantage of having access to other resources on the system.
Your runner can execute other scripts on your machine, enabling complex tasks not easily possible on GitHub-hosted runners.

Fortunately, it only takes one line to add to your YAML to instruct GitHub to use your self-hosted runner:
**`runs-on: self-hosted`**
```yaml title=".github/workflows/my_workflow.yml"
name: Deploy blog

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_push_image:
    name:            Build and push image to GHCR.io
    runs-on:         self-hosted
    timeout-minutes: 10
```
