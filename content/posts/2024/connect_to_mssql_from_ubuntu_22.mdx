## Install Microsoft Server tools, the right way
Skip all of my struggles, just punch in these commands one line at a time.
``` bash title="Assuming you are logged in as root, and have wget installed"
mkdir -p /root/.gnupg/S.dirmngr && chmod 600 /root/.gnupg/
gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
wget -qO /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/mssql-prod.list
sed -i 's/\(deb \[arch=[^]]*\)/\1 signed-by=\/usr\/share\/keyrings\/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg/' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list
apt update
apt install mssql-tools
```


## Install Microsoft Server tools, the wrong way
I've documented all the wrong ways of getting this configured in case somebody else follows bad instructions and gets stuck.


### Add the Microsoft apt repository
``` bash title=""
# add-apt-repository "$(wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/mssql-prod.list)"
Repository: 'deb [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod jammy main'
Description:

```


### Add the signing GPG key
Notice at the end the error about the repo not being signed? Let's import Microsoft's signing key into a new GPG keyring.
Next we'll use Ubuntu's official keyserver to import the key needed to verify the integrity of the MSSQL repo.
``` bash title="Don't use the deprecated apt-key command, use GPG keyrings instead"
# sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
gpg: failed to create temporary file '/root/.gnupg/.#lk0x000062230980e220.InvinciCODE.1056950': No such file or directory
gpg: connecting dirmngr at '/root/.gnupg/S.dirmngr' failed: No such file or directory
gpg: keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr
```

We can create the missing directory and re-run the command
``` bash title="Note the unsafe permissions, we will fix them"
# mkdir -p /root/.gnupg/S.dirmngr

# gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir '/root/.gnupg'
```

``` bash title="Let's fix the directory permissions and try again"
# chmod 600 /root/.gnupg/

# gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys EB3E94ADBE1229CF
gpg: key EB3E94ADBE1229CF: "Microsoft (Release signing) <gpgsecurity@microsoft.com>" not changed
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
```

``` bash title="Try again"

```

### Configure the apt repo to use the GPG key
At this point we have the repo added, we have the singing key added to a new keyring, but the repo isn't configured to reference the new signing GPG keyring.

``` bash title="Find the name of the MSSQL repo file, rename it to something easy"
# ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ | grep -i mssql
archive_uri-https_packages_microsoft_com_ubuntu_22_04_prod-jammy.list

# mv /etc/apt/sources.list.d/archive_uri-https_packages_microsoft_com_ubuntu_22_04_prod-jammy.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list
```

``` bash title="Lets inspect the repo, notice the missing reference to our MSSQL GPG keyring?"
# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list

deb [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod jammy main
# deb-src [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod jammy main
```

``` bash title="Use SED or your favorite text editor to add a reference to the MSSQL GPG keyring"
# sed -i 's/\(deb \[arch=[^]]*\)/\1 signed-by=\/usr\/share\/keyrings\/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg/g' /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list

# cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-prod.list
deb [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod jammy main
# deb-src [arch=amd64,armhf,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mssql-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/22.04/prod jammy main
```


### Finally, install MSSQL tools
``` bash title="Refresh available apt packages"
# apt update
Hit:1 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy InRelease
Hit:2 http://ca.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy InRelease
Hit:3 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security InRelease

Finally! We have successfully securely configured the MSSQL Server 2022 repository. Now we can move onto installing MSSQL Server 2022.
``` bash title="Finally, install MSSQL tools"
# apt install mssql-tools
```

``` bash title="Add MSSQL tools to $PATH"
# export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"

# which sqlcmd
/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd
```

``` bash title="Persist new $PATH across reboots"
# echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

``` bash title="Connect to your MSSQL server"
# sqlcmd -S <hostname_or_IP>,<port> -U <username> -P <password>
```
