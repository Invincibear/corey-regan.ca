**Scenario**: you need to use the `argocd` CLI, but you must first log in, and Argo CD isn't being served from the root path, e.g. `https://argocd.mydomain.tld/argocd`


The following are instructions for Ubuntu. You might need to look up instructions for your OS.
```bash title="Install the argocd CLI"
# Download the version of Argo CD CLI matching your current deployment
export $VERSION=v2.10.4
curl -sSL -o argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/download/$VERSION/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 555 argocd /usr/local/bin/argocd
```

Now log into Argo CD. It will open a new page in your browser to complete the authentication. If you don't use SSO, remove the `--sso` flag.
```bash title="Log into argocd.domain.tld/argocd"
# Login using SSO and grpc-web
argocd login argocd.mydomain.tld --sso --grpc-web --grpc-web-root-path "/argocd"
```
