SELinux is good at not allowing anything to happen on a system unless it is authorized.
Here are a few handy commands that help me get a new web server up and running, and allowing its websites to send emails.


## Web Servers
```bash title="Restore default permissions to www folders/files"
chcon -Rv --user system_u --type httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/folder/or/file
```

```bash title="Make www folders/files writable"
chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t /var/www/html/folder/or/file
```

## Postfix Mail Server
To allow HTTPd to send mail via Postfix, there is a SELinux boolean to set.
```bash title="verify functionality is disabled"
getsebool httpd_can_sendmail
```

```bash title="If false (disabled), enable it. The -P flag denotes persistence (setting survives reboots)"
setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1
```

```bash title="Can also restore SELinux context to main.cf"
restorecon -v /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

```bash title="Reset Postfix permissions"
postfix set-permissions
```
