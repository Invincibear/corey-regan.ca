description: Importing existing Azure resources into Terraform Cloud should be straight-forward, using the terraform CLI to import them is not, but using the new import {} code blocks is.

<Callout>This article was written before Terraform introduced `import {}` blocks in `v1.5.0`, and was centered around using the `terraform import` CLI command. This article has been updated to include examples of the simpler `import {}` code blocks. You can skip most of this post by simply adding `import {}` blocks to your code. You can leave them in once imported, or comment them out, or delete them.</Callout>

There are times when you have written code to deploy a resource to Azure but that resource was already created. In this instance, TFC is unable to create the resource and tells you to instead import it into the TF state.
The process is similar to manually editing Terraform Cloud state file, with the exception that you do not need to upload anything back to TFC once the resource is imported.

In short, the procedure using the `terraform` CLI involves:
1. Reconfiguring the TFC Workspace's main `terraform {}` code block on your local machine to use the `backend "remote" {}` backend instead of the `cloud {}` backend
2. Initializing the TF code on your local machine
3. Importing the resource into TF

**Note:** This assumes you already have the TF CLI installed on your local machine. If you don't, [follow these instructions to set it up](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli).


## Procedure Using Terraform import {} Blocks
As of Terraform `1.5.0`, you can now [code an `import {}` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) instead of running a `terraform import` command.
  ``` terraform
  import {
    id = "/subscriptions/my_subscription_id/resourceGroups/my_resource_group_name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my_cluster_name"
    to = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.my_cluster_name
  }
  ```

## Procedure Using Terraform's CLI
* Ensure you have a copy of the TF code downloaded to your machine

* In your main terraform block (I like to use `providers.tf`), temporarily comment out the `cloud {}` code block
  ``` terraform
  terraform {
  #  cloud {
  #    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  #    organization = "my_organization"
  #    workspaces {
  #      tags = ["my_app"]
  #    }
  #  }
  }
  ```

* Still in `providers.tf`, configure a `backend "remote" {}` code block inside the main `terraform {}` code block
  ``` terraform
  terraform {
  #  cloud {
  #    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  #    organization = "my_organization"
  #    workspaces {
  #      tags = ["my_app"]
  #    }
  #  }

    backend "remote" {
      hostname = "app.terraform.io"
      organization = "my_organization"
      workspaces {
        name = "my_workspace_name"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
* Execute on your machine: `terraform init -reconfigure`

* Import the resource using `terraform import resource.resource_name_here /resource/id/here`
  ``` terraform title="Example importing an Azure AKS Kubernetes cluster:"
  terraform import azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.my_cluster_name /subscriptions/my_subscription_id/resourceGroups/my_resource_group_name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my_cluster_name
  ```
  ``` terraform title="Expressed as an import {} code block:"
  import {
    id = "/subscriptions/my_subscription_id/resourceGroups/my_resource_group_name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my_cluster_name"
    to = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.my_cluster_name
  }
  ```

* If the resource lives inside a module, you **must include the module in the resource path**. For example, if the workspace calls on module `my_module` to spin up a k8s cluster, you would execute:
  ``` terraform
  terraform import module.my_module.azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.my_cluster_name /subscriptions/my_subscription_id/resourceGroups/my_resource_group_name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my_cluster_name
  ```
  ``` terraform title="Expressed as an import {} code block:"
  import {
    id = "/subscriptions/my_subscription_id/resourceGroups/my_resource_group_name/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/my_cluster_name"
    to = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.my_cluster_name
  }
  ```

* Remove the temporary `backend "remote" {}` code block from `providers.tf` and uncomment the original `cloud {}` code block:
  ``` terraform
  terraform {
    cloud {
      hostname = "app.terraform.io"
      organization = "my_organization"
      workspaces {
        tags = ["my_app"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
