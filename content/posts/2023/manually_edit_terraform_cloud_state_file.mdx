There are rare occasions where you will be required to manually edit a Terraform state file.
One such scenario would be if you manually delete Azure resources through the Azure GUI and subsequent terraform apply commands also attempt to delete the already-deleted resources (and fails).

In this case, a Terraform Cloud state refresh will not pick up that the "missing" resources have already been deleted, and future `terraform apply` commands will continue to fail.

Your options are to either execute `terraform state rm resource.name`, or manually remove the resource from the Terraform state file.

Unfortunately, Terraform Cloud does not offer a native mechanism to edit state files, but we can still do it manually.


#### In short, the procedure involves:
1. Downloading the newest Terraform Cloud state file to your local machine
2. Locally manipulating the downloaded Terraform Cloud `.tfstate` file
3. Reconfiguring the Terraform Cloud Workspace's `main.tf` on your local machine to use the `backend "remote" {}` backend instead of the `cloud {}` backend
4. Initializing the Terraform code on your local machine
5. Pushing the manipulated Terraform Cloud state file back to Terraform Cloud
6. Restoring your original backend and re-initializing it, locally

<Callout>**Note**: Do not save the Terraform Cloud state file to `.terraform/terraform.tfstate` because `terraform state push` will treat it as a normal state file and will fail to upload due to Terraform Cloud using state version `4` whereas the Terraform CLI only supports state versions \<= `3`</Callout>

<Callout>**Note**: This assumes you already have the Terraform CLI installed on your local machine. If you don't, follow these instructions to set it up: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli</Callout>


## Procedure
* Ensure you have a copy of the Terraform code downloaded to your machine

* On your workstation, delete the `.terraform/` and `terraform.tfstate.d/` folders if they exist (they will only exist if you've previously run `terraform` commands in the stack).

* In your main terraform block (I like to use `providers.tf`), temporarily comment out the `cloud {}` code block.
  ```terraform title="providers.tf"
  terraform {
  #  cloud {
  #    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  #    organization = "my_organization"
  #    workspaces {
  #      tags = ["my_app"]
  #    }
  #  }
  }
  ```


## Manually editing Terraform Cloud state file

* Still in `providers.tf`, configure a `backend "remote" {}` code block inside the main `terraform {}` code block.
  ```terraform title="providers.tf"
  terraform {
  #  cloud {
  #    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  #    organization = "my_organization"
  #    workspaces {
  #      tags = ["my_app"]
  #    }
  #  }

    backend "remote" {
      hostname = "app.terraform.io"
      organization = "my_organization"
      workspaces {
        name = "my_workspace_name"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* Execute on your machine: `terraform init -reconfigure`

* In Terraform Cloud, go to your Workspace -> State -> Download the latest state file and save it to `/local/path/to/repo/`

* Manipulate the downloaded state file as needed.

* Upload the modified `.tfstate` file to Terraform Cloud by executing: `terraform state push /local/path/to/repo/ filename.tfstate`
  <Callout>**Troubleshooting**: If you get the error "Failed to write state: cannot overwrite existing state with serial number with a different state that has the same serial", simply increment the `"serial"` number at the top of the downloaded `.tfstate` file and retry `terraform state push`</Callout>

* Remove the temporary `backend "remote" {}` code block from `providers.tf` and uncomment the original `cloud {}` code block:
  ```terraform title=" "
  terraform {
    cloud {
      hostname = "app.terraform.io"
      organization = "my_organization"
      workspaces {
        tags = ["my_app"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* Execute on your machine: `terraform init -reconfigure`
