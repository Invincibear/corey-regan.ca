# TODO
- If scrolled past wormhole end, abort auto-scroll
- Bug: can't navigate to blog, causes 404, perhaps wormhole destruction is failing? (console msg)
- Blog tags prefetching returns 404s
- Add math to calculate wormhole auto-scroll time based on how close to the end the user has already scrolled. This is really only for refreshes and my troubleshooting, but I shouldn't need to wait the full 12 seconds if I'm barely scrolled above the end of the wormhole sequence
- Incorporate mouse-tracked background highlight
